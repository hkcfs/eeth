# (っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ Welcome to **EETH** ♥

Hello, world! 🌍

This blog is my little corner of the internet, where I share my adventures in the realms of **Linux**, **Android**, and all things **technical**. From tinkering with hardware to hacking software to make it do the impossible, this space is dedicated to everything I find fascinating about computers and technology.

## 🛠️ About Me
- **First-time Blogger**: This is my first-ever blog, built with **Hugo**, and I’m learning as I go. So bear with me as I figure things out!
- **Tech Enthusiast**: My hobbies include:
  - Running Linux on every possible device 🐧
  - Pushing hardware to do things it was never meant to do
  - Exploring the wild, untamed world of tech
  - Love AI, almost every part of it

This website is not just a blog—it’s an extension of my personality. My goal is to create a space that reflects who I am: curious, experimental, and just a little bit chaotic.

*(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ Thanks for stopping by ♥*
