Subject: How Freelancer Company are Really - Sorry if that title is too generic/clickbate

Hello,

I have watched many videos of yours old and new & have always loved your work. I'm currently still in high school (please redact this), so my English or wording might not be great, and no, I do not want to use ai as it might be taken as spam.

My father works as a freelancer 10-20 years back it was a great job where people earned handsomely....but now it looks like everything is taken granted for....**An complete AI model from scratch for $50**, is this some kind of joke and no every freelancing sites are filled with 10,000 people competing for a single project...and the clients are getting used to this one of my fathers old client came up to develop an AI-tool for Note generation with image generation pdf, doc support and **real time conversation** & a web gui with caching this was 4 months back at the time not a very easy take so my father quotes $300 the client after seeing this asks for to be done in $90....how can a person survive in this as no company are hiring and **client think to make facebook it will take you $400 & 3 days** & the best part the client got a the freelancer told him can we work from outside & after aggering he made some kind of a low-AI coded mess when the final payment was done...the client realised how bad it really was when something stopped working guess what the **freelancer obfuscated the code** the entire project was done for $60, a joke.

The freelancing sites themselves, once you make this mistake there is nothing to do my father does very niche work so not a lot of projects but the worst part is that, **ALL FREELANCING SITE TAKE A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION OF $10-$40/month and even after that 10% or $5 from every transaction** so a $6000 project the is actually $5400 and worst part of them all the clients has to pay $6606 so it is more like 20% and for that what yo get nothing....My father did a project $90 to setup nextcloud, with custom theming, an email server and make the server secure yes all that for $90 & at the very end when the job was completed the client told there was a mistake and told that we missed the deadline it was 2 AM my father told him that can we work tomorrow as it was very late for him...the client furious put a tantrum and then decided to ask for freelancer support and guess want we had to refund everything for free and gets to keep our work & if that was not enough a **2 week ban**, guess what the client did not get any ban or suc in fact they made a new post to fix the issues in the current project for $2 when we told freelancer.com they just gave us a generic responce to stay out of trouble...this is how we used to make ends meal, after after this one inciden we have constant have been penalized for this now we fell like it is a daily routeen every 3 week -$150 and a ban for 5 days for some new garbage they made up.

It is now, i am writing you as we are not big in the tech world and you do have an audience, **recently my account was suspended** for no reason when asking freelancer they mailed use that you have violated the policy to many time, they deducted our months income completely for have outside transactions they didn't even bother to show use any evidence I am not sure in **which country hiding evidence is allowed when you are making an accusation**, and even had the **audacity to charge our credit card now that is too much**. I am very frustrated that how freelancer like my father have to struggle, hope you can shed some light to this also this is all on x.com/twitter on the profile BharatBjoshi [x.com/BharatBjoshi](https://x.com/BharatBjoshi) please check

Sorry, if this looks like a rant but I am very furious at how these websites treated my father, if you want  I will try to collect evidence to share it with you.

Thanks & Regards,
Jayesh Joshi.

Nothing more to add this sums up everything.
