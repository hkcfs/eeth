And yeah, for training the next big ChatGPT, you&rsquo;d be absolutely right. But what if I told you that the future of practical, everyday AI isn&rsquo;t always about gigawatt power bills and million-dollar server racks?</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s about a tiny, open-source chip, costing less than a fancy coffee, tucked away in a board the size of a credit card? Welcome to the wild, exciting, and sometimes frustrating world of cheap RISC-V Single Board Computers (SBCs) with dedicated NPUs. This is where AI moves from the data center to your desk, your drone, or even your dog&rsquo;s collar, all on a budget. And yes, it actually works.</p>
<h2 id="the-ai-dream-on-a-dollar-store-budget">The AI Dream on a Dollar Store Budget</h2>
<p>For a long time, if you wanted to do <em>any</em> kind of AI on a small device, you were usually stuck with an expensive Raspberry Pi or similar ARM board, maybe with a clunky USB accelerator attached that cost more than the board itself. But the scene is changing, and it&rsquo;s getting <em>awesome</em> for cheap hardware enthusiasts. We&rsquo;re seeing a surge of new, incredibly affordable SBCs, often powered by the open-source <strong>RISC-V</strong> architecture, that come with dedicated <strong>NPUs (Neural Processing Units)</strong> baked right into the silicon.</p>
<p>Why is this a big deal?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective AI:</strong> Get dedicated AI processing for ridiculously low prices. We&rsquo;re talking single-digit dollars for some of these boards. <strong>Yes, even cheaper than that artisanal coffee.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Power Efficiency:</strong> NPUs are explicitly designed for <strong>inference</strong> (running <em>already trained</em> AI models) with minimal power consumption. This makes them perfect for battery-powered gadgets or always-on home projects where your electric bill is a real concern.</li>
<li><strong>Edge Computing:</strong> This hardware pushes AI smarts right to the device itself (&ldquo;the edge&rdquo;), reducing latency, improving privacy (because data stays local!), and cutting down on those pesky cloud computing costs. Your smart doorbell can see a package without telling <strong>All-Might Google</strong> everything it saw.</li>
<li><strong>Open Hardware Future:</strong> RISC-V is an open instruction set, meaning anyone can build chips based on it without paying hefty licensing fees to ARM or Intel. This fosters a Cambrian explosion of innovation and aggressively drives prices down.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about training your own version of Stable Diffusion for free on a board that fits in your wallet. This is about running tiny, efficient AI models (like recognizing a cat, detecting a specific voice command, monitoring a production line for anomalies, or doing basic facial detection) right where the action happens.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-crop-of-cheap-ai-brains">The New Crop of Cheap AI Brains</h2>
<p>Here are some of the stars of this budget-AI revolution, showing what&rsquo;s possible for under $50, sometimes even under $10. Prepare to be amazed by how much compute power you can now get for pocket change:</p>
<h3 id="1-sipeed-maix-i-based-on-kendryte-k210">1. Sipeed MAix-I (Based on Kendryte K210)</h3>
<p>This board was one of the early pioneers, almost a &ldquo;vintage&rdquo; entry in the cheap RISC-V AI scene.

</ul>
<h2 id="the-reality-check-no-free-lunch-but-a-cheap-one">The Reality Check: No Free Lunch (But a Cheap One!)</h2>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s be real. These boards are amazing for their price, but they aren&rsquo;t magic pixie dust.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Resources:</strong> That 16MB of flash or 128MB of RAM isn&rsquo;t going to let you run a full web server <em>and</em> train a huge AI model simultaneously. These are optimized for <em>inference</em> of specific, often smaller, AI models. Think &ldquo;does this picture contain a dog?&rdquo; not &ldquo;generate a photorealistic image of a dog chasing a cat on the moon.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Software Ecosystem (Still Growing):</strong> The software ecosystem for RISC-V, especially with AI frameworks and specialized drivers, is still maturing. It&rsquo;s getting better <em>fast</em>, but you might need to compile things from source, dig through GitHub issues, or adjust configurations more than on a Raspberry Pi. It&rsquo;s part of the adventure!</li>
<li><strong>Learning Curve (Embrace It!):</strong> If you&rsquo;re new to embedded Linux or RISC-V, there&rsquo;s definitely a bit of a learning curve. Expect to use the command line, read documentation (sometimes poorly translated!), and enjoy the occasional &ldquo;why isn&rsquo;t this working?&rdquo; moment. But that&rsquo;s where the real learning happens.</li>
<li><strong>Inference, Not Training:</strong> Let&rsquo;s say it again for the people in the back: you&rsquo;re running <em>already trained</em> AI models. Training large AI models still needs those <strong>fat, hungry Nvidia GPUs</strong> in a cloud data center, or <strong>All-Might Google&rsquo;s</strong> TPUs. These tiny boards are the unsung heroes of deployment, not development.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-open-and-accessible">Conclusion: The Future of AI is Open and Accessible</h2>
<p>The rise of these incredibly cheap, NPU-equipped (or AI-capable) RISC-V SBCs is a huge win for open hardware and accessible AI. It means more people can experiment, innovate, and deploy AI solutions in places that were previously too expensive, too power-hungry, or simply too closed-off. From smart home gadgets to custom industrial sensors, the possibilities are literally exploding at prices you can&rsquo;t ignore.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to dabble in AI on actual hardware without <strong>mortgaging your house for a GPU</strong> or paying <strong>All-Might Google&rsquo;s cloud bills</strong>, now&rsquo;s the time. Grab one of these tiny boards, flash some Linux (or even just an RTOS), and start making your cheap hardware dreams come true. It might be small, it might make you scratch your head a few times, but it&rsquo;s proof that sometimes, the most exciting innovations happen on the smallest budgets, and the most powerful tools are often the ones you can actually afford to play with.</p>

Yeah, me too. Back then, your <strong>fat, hungry Nvidia</strong> or <strong>AMD GPU</strong> was the undisputed king of anything that smelled vaguely like parallel processing. But just when we all got comfortable talking about GPUs, the tech world decided to throw a whole new alphabet soup at us: TPUs, NPUs, and probably a few other &ldquo;engines&rdquo; or &ldquo;accelerators&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t even caught up on yet. It feels like every new phone or laptop now proudly mentions its &ldquo;AI Engine&rdquo; or &ldquo;Neural Processor&rdquo; as if it&rsquo;s the secret sauce for eternal life.</p>
<p>Honestly, it can be a bit much. You see all these fancy names, read articles, and hear buzzwords, and it all just blurs into &ldquo;AI needs special chips!&rdquo; But what <em>kind</em> of special? And for <em>what</em> exactly? Are they just trying to sell us more silicon? (Spoiler: mostly, yes.)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s cut through the noise, skip the super dry academic stuff, and break down what GPUs, TPUs, and NPUs actually are, why they exist, and what they&rsquo;re best at. You&rsquo;ll see that, like with any tool (or any diet plan), the &ldquo;best&rdquo; one really depends on the job. No single chip is going to make you an all-might AI wizard overnight, despite what the marketing teams might whisper.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-reliable-gpu-graphics-processing-unit">The Old Reliable: GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Okay, so we all probably know the GPU best from gaming. It&rsquo;s the engine that makes those incredible visuals happen on your screen, letting you see every pixel of that high-fidelity explosion. Companies like <strong>Nvidia</strong> and <strong>AMD</strong> are the giants here, always pushing out bigger, faster, and more power-hungry cards.</p>
<p><strong>How it works for AI:</strong> Turns out, the way GPUs handle game graphics – by doing tons of simple math operations all at once for millions of pixels – is <em>perfect</em> for AI, especially for training neural networks. Think of it: AI models, especially deep learning ones, are basically just huge networks of math. They need to multiply big grids of numbers (called matrices) over and over again. A GPU is a master at this kind of <strong>parallel processing</strong>, meaning it can do thousands of these calculations at the exact same time. It&rsquo;s like having an army of tiny, identical calculators all working on different parts of the problem simultaneously, reporting back to the general (your CPU). This makes your GPU not just a gaming beast, but a formidable AI trainer.</p>
<p><strong>Best Use Cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General AI Training (and draining your wallet):</strong> If you&rsquo;re building a new AI model from scratch, whether it&rsquo;s for recognizing faces, understanding language, or something else entirely, a powerful GPU is usually your main tool. They offer great flexibility for various model architectures, which is why everyone from researchers to big tech is still <strong>throwing money at Nvidia</strong> for their top-tier GPUs.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy Computing:</strong> Beyond AI, GPUs are still vital for scientific studies, big data analysis, and even cracking complex codes.</li>
<li><strong>Gaming:</strong> And, of course, they still make our games look amazing, justifying that electric bill.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Inference:</strong> Running trained AI models when your computer needs to do other tasks too, because why buy <em>another</em> specialized chip when you already have this monster?</li>

<h2 id="the-specialized-speedster-tpu-tensor-processing-unit">The Specialized Speedster: TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> This is <strong>All-Might Google&rsquo;s</strong> custom-built chip. You won&rsquo;t find it in your local electronics store; these live mostly in Google&rsquo;s massive data centers and are available through their cloud services. It&rsquo;s designed specifically for Google&rsquo;s own AI framework, TensorFlow, because <strong>why would Google use someone else&rsquo;s hardware for their own special sauce, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How it&rsquo;s different:</strong> Think of it this way: a GPU is like a super-flexible sports car – fast at many things. A TPU, however, is like a drag-racing car – it&rsquo;s built <em>only</em> to go incredibly fast in a straight line, which in this case, is deep learning math. It has special parts called &ldquo;Matrix Multiply Units&rdquo; (MXUs) that can crank out thousands of matrix calculations in a single heartbeat. This &ldquo;made-for-AI&rdquo; design means TPUs are insanely efficient and fast for the specific math tasks that neural networks love, especially within Google&rsquo;s ecosystem. They don&rsquo;t have the GPU&rsquo;s general flexibility, but for <em>their</em> job, they&rsquo;re unbeatable.</p>
<p><strong>Best Use Cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Massive AI Training (Google Cloud, because, well, Google):</strong> If you&rsquo;re a big company or research group with huge AI models, especially using TensorFlow, TPUs in the cloud can offer unmatched speed and cost-effectiveness. <strong>Just don&rsquo;t try to install one in your basement.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Google&rsquo;s Own AI:</strong> These chips power many of Google&rsquo;s AI services that you use every day, like Google Translate or the AI behind search results. They&rsquo;re basically the secret ingredient in Google&rsquo;s massive AI recipe.</li>
<li><strong>Big-Scale Inference:</strong> Running already-trained, very large AI models super fast within Google&rsquo;s cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-edge-brain-npu-neural-processing-unit">The Edge Brain: NPU (Neural Processing Unit)</h2>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> This is the newest kid on the block, and you&rsquo;re probably already using one without realizing it! NPUs are small, specialized chips showing up in your smartphones, smart speakers, newer laptops, and other &ldquo;edge&rdquo; devices (meaning, directly on the device itself, not in a distant data center). Think of Apple&rsquo;s Neural Engine or the AI Engines in Qualcomm chips – <strong>every company wants their own special name for it, of course.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How it&rsquo;s different:</strong> NPUs are all about <strong>inference</strong> – that&rsquo;s when a <em>trained</em> AI model actually does its job (like recognizing a face or understanding a voice command). They are built for extreme <strong>power efficiency</strong> and fast reactions, specifically for AI tasks that need to happen right away on your device. They might not be as flexible as a GPU (they often handle specific types of AI math or models), but they do it with hardly any battery drain. This is crucial because <strong>your phone battery already suffers enough</strong>, right?</p>
<p><strong>Best Use Cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI on Your Device (and keeping your data local):</strong> This is why your phone can unlock with your face in a blink, instantly make photos look better, process your voice commands without sending them to the internet, or run local AI chatbots. It&rsquo;s about getting AI smarts <em>without</em> constantly pinging the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Low-Power Gadgets:</strong> Perfect for battery-powered devices where sending data to the cloud takes too long, uses too much battery, or isn&rsquo;t private enough.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile and Embedded AI:</strong> Bringing smart AI features directly into everyday gadgets, from your smart doorbell to your new fridge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the thing: nobody &ldquo;wins&rdquo; this fight. Each chip is a champion in its own arena. It’s not about finding one chip to rule them all, but understanding which chip is best for <em>which specific job</em>. Trying to use an NPU to train a multi-billion parameter model is like bringing a spoon to a bulldozer fight.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-actually-matters-to-you">Why This Actually Matters to You</h2>
<p>Knowing these differences isn&rsquo;t just for tech experts; it actually affects how AI is made, used, and how it shows up in your daily life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you&rsquo;re building AI:</strong> Picking the right hardware means you save a ton of time and money. Trying to train a giant AI model on an NPU is impossible. Trying to deploy a super-efficient face unlock feature using a cloud GPU for every user&rsquo;s phone would be ridiculously slow and expensive.</li>
<li><strong>If you&rsquo;re a normal user:</strong> NPUs are why your phone can unlock with your face in a blink, instantly make photos look better, or understand your voice commands without sending everything to the internet. This is a big deal for your privacy and how fast your gadgets react.</li>
<li><strong>For big companies:</strong> TPUs help <strong>All-Might Google</strong> run its massive AI services. GPUs are the bedrock for almost all new AI research and development across many industries, fueling the constant competition between tech titans.</li>
</ul>
<p>The real secret isn&rsquo;t finding the <em>perfect</em> chip. It&rsquo;s about knowing each chip&rsquo;s strengths. Just like I learned that the best todo system is the one you actually use because there&rsquo;s nothing to overthink, the best AI hardware is the one that&rsquo;s <em>purpose-built</em> for the task at hand. Trying to force one chip to do everything usually leads to wasted resources, poor performance, or just plain frustration.</p>
<p>So, next time you hear about an amazing AI feature, take a moment. There&rsquo;s probably a whole team of specialized chips working together behind the scenes, each doing exactly what it was designed for. And somewhere, a marketing team is frantically trying to come up with the next catchy acronym to make you <em>think</em> you need their latest widget.</p>

<p>As of today, my website is out in public! 🎉, and I thought I&rsquo;d share my pipeline for creating this blog.</p>
<h2 id="text-editors-lite-xl-vs-neovim">Text Editors: Lite-XL vs. Neovim</h2>
<p>One of the most important tools in my workflow is my text editor. I use <strong>Emacs</strong>—just kidding! It&rsquo;s <code>neovim</code>. But lately, I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl">Lite-XL</a>, which, to be honest, is a fantastic text editor.</p>
<p>Lite-XL is configured in <strong>Lua</strong>, so if you&rsquo;re coming from Neovim, there&rsquo;s no need to learn a new language. Even if you&rsquo;re not familiar with Lua, it&rsquo;s not as tough as adding patches in DWM. Lite-XL has been great—no complaints whatsoever—and it&rsquo;s what I started writing my blogs in.</p>
<p>But after months of using it, I feel like switching back to Neovim as my primary editor. That said, it&rsquo;s still undecided.</p>
<h2 id="hugo-the-backbone-of-the-blog">Hugo: The Backbone of the Blog</h2>
<p>Text editors are only half the story. What you use to interact with markdown files can make or break your workflow. My choice? <strong>Hugo</strong>.</p>
<p>I looked at Hexo and Jekyll, but they lacked the support and features that Hugo offers. The simplicity and speed of Hugo are what drew me to it. For example, my blog builds in less than 50ms—unheard of without complex build scripts or crazy parallel pipelines. Hugo is blazing fast, optimized &amp; lightweight solution, and I&rsquo;ve been using it ever since.</p>
<h2 id="my-pipeline-the-process">My Pipeline: The Process</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I make it all happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Writing and Editing</strong>
I write my blogs using <strong>Lite-XL</strong> or <strong>Neovim</strong> with some custom configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improving Grammar and Style</strong>
After writing, I run the content through <code>ollama</code> yes AI but not in the tradition scene. I use it to clean up grammar, fix punctuation, and improve sentence structure, you haven&rsquo;t seen my horriable grammer. However, I write everything myself—English isn&rsquo;t my first language, so my vocabulary is often limited. That&rsquo;s where AI helps me, forgive me great AI overloads.</p>
<p>I run <code>ollama</code> using the Llama-3.2-3B model because I don&rsquo;t have powerful hardware. The 3B model works fine for me. The 1B model felt limited and wasn&rsquo;t much better with English. The 3B model strikes the right balance.</p>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">28</span><span class="cl">Arch Linux is similar to LFS (Linux From Scratch) but more streamlined.

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">30</span><span class="cl">If you want to learn Linux but don&#39;t want to spend countless hours with Gentoo&#39;s source-based installation, Arch is a good choice. However, I don&#39;t recommend using the <span class="sb">`archinstall`</span> script unless you&#39;re already familiar with Linux. It&#39;s best for users who have manually installed Arch at least once, especially with custom configurations like Btrfs, custom repos, or even Artix instead of Arch.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">31</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">32</span><span class="cl">Arch is a rolling release, meaning there are no fixed versions. Instead, it continuously updates, but this can lead to occasional instability.
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">33</span><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">34</span><span class="cl">While Arch can support niche setups (e.g., running Linux from Google Drive, as shown [<span class="nt">here</span>](<span class="na">https://ersei.net/en/blog/fuse-root</span>)), I would suggest Alpine for lightweight and specialized use cases.

<h2 id="why-not-github-pages">Why Not GitHub Pages?</h2>
<p>I initially considered GitHub Pages but ultimately decided that Cloudflare was the better choice. My domain, <code>eeth.us.to</code>, redirects to Cloudflare Pages, providing flexibility. If any issues arise, I can easily switch back to GitHub Pages. After all, it&rsquo;s never a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket.</p>
