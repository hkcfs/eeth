      <description>&lt;p&gt;People often think you need a powerful, expensive computer to run a good home server or NAS (Network Attached Storage). They imagine big, noisy machines with lots of fast parts. But I&amp;rsquo;m here to share a story about a very old, weak computer that does a great job, showing that you can do a lot with less if you pick the right software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My &amp;ldquo;NAS&amp;rdquo; is actually just an old Dell laptop. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing special: it has an old &lt;strong&gt;Intel J1900 processor&lt;/strong&gt;, which is about as powerful as a Raspberry Pi 3B+. It only has &lt;strong&gt;4GB of RAM&lt;/strong&gt;. And get this: the internal hard drive port broke a long time ago, so I can only use external hard drives connected by USB. Plus, the main internet port stopped working, so I have to use a &lt;strong&gt;USB-to-Ethernet adapter&lt;/strong&gt; for network access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People often think you need a powerful, expensive computer to run a good home server or NAS (Network Attached Storage). They imagine big, noisy machines with lots of fast parts. But I&rsquo;m here to share a story about a very old, weak computer that does a great job, showing that you can do a lot with less if you pick the right software.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;NAS&rdquo; is actually just an old Dell laptop. It&rsquo;s nothing special: it has an old <strong>Intel J1900 processor</strong>, which is about as powerful as a Raspberry Pi 3B+. It only has <strong>4GB of RAM</strong>. And get this: the internal hard drive port broke a long time ago, so I can only use external hard drives connected by USB. Plus, the main internet port stopped working, so I have to use a <strong>USB-to-Ethernet adapter</strong> for network access.</p>
<p>Sounds like trash, right? Most people would throw it away. But for me, it&rsquo;s a perfect example of what you can achieve with smart software and a focus on keeping things simple. This isn&rsquo;t just for storing files; it&rsquo;s a full home server running many useful programs, and it uses very little electricity.</p>
<h2 id="the-computer-an-old-but-useful-machine">The Computer: An Old but Useful Machine</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look closer at the computer itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel J1900 (4 cores, 4 threads, low speed). This chip was made for basic computers that don&rsquo;t need fans, so it uses very little power. But it&rsquo;s not fast at all for big tasks.</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 4GB DDR3. This is often the smallest amount of memory people suggest for any server, especially one running container programs like Docker. Managing this memory well is super important.</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> All my storage is on external hard drives connected through USB. This means the speed of moving data is limited by the USB ports, which are not as fast as internal connections like SATA.</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> I use a USB-to-Ethernet adapter. This could sometimes cause problems with stability or speed if the adapter or its software isn&rsquo;t good.</li>
</ul>
<p>This laptop wasn&rsquo;t built to be powerful. It was made for simple office work or just browsing the internet. But now, it&rsquo;s the core of my home data system, proving that you don&rsquo;t always need a lot of raw power.</p>
<h2 id="alpine-linux-the-operating-system-for-small-computers">Alpine Linux: The Operating System for Small Computers</h2>
<p>The real trick to making this work is the operating system: <strong>Alpine Linux</strong>. For computers with limited resources, Alpine is the best choice. Here’s why it was perfect for my setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very Small Size:</strong> Alpine is incredibly tiny. It uses a different main system library (<code>musl libc</code> instead of <code>glibc</code>), which makes programs very small and keeps the basic system very compact. This means it uses very little disk space and, most importantly, very little RAM.</li>
<li><strong>Security First:</strong> Alpine uses a specially hardened version of the Linux kernel and has strong security features built in. This makes it a very safe base for any server, reducing the ways hackers could get in.</li>
<li><strong>Great for Docker:</strong> Alpine is well-known for working perfectly with Docker. Because it&rsquo;s so small, container images built on Alpine are also tiny, and its package manager (<code>apk</code>) is fast and efficient. This makes it very easy to run containerized applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Alpine is so small, when the laptop is just on and doing nothing, it uses only about <strong>170MB of RAM</strong>. Yes, on a 4GB RAM laptop, less than 200MB is used just for the operating system! This leaves a lot of memory free for the services I want to run.</p>
<h2 id="the-software-stack-docker-and-my-favorite-programs">The Software Stack: Docker and My Favorite Programs</h2>
<p>To run many programs on one machine without them getting in each other&rsquo;s way, I use <strong>Docker</strong>. Docker lets me put each program into its own isolated &ldquo;box&rdquo; called a container. This makes setting them up, updating them, and keeping them separate from the main system much easier.</p>
<p>Here are the important programs running on this small Dell NAS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Immich (Self-hosted Photo Backup):</strong> This program is like a private version of Google Photos. It backs up all my pictures and videos from my phone and other devices. It has special AI features that can recognize faces, objects, and sort photos automatically.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Detail:</strong> Immich&rsquo;s AI features are very demanding. When it&rsquo;s doing a lot of work, like scanning a big batch of new photos, the J1900 CPU goes up to <strong>99-100% usage</strong>. The RAM used by all my services, which is usually around 800MB, can jump to <strong>2.5GB or even 3GB</strong> during these heavy AI tasks. It&rsquo;s not super fast, but it <em>does</em> get the job done in the background. It keeps processing my photos, making them organized and searchable. This shows how good Immich is at using resources and how Docker helps keep big programs from breaking the whole system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kopia (Backup System):</strong> This is my main program for backups. Kopia takes my important files, encrypts them (scrambles them so only I can read them), and stores them efficiently by only saving unique parts of files (<code>deduplication</code>). This saves a lot of disk space. It works perfectly on the external hard drive and also sends copies to my cloud storage for safekeeping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Filebrowser-quantum (Web File Manager):</strong> This is a simple website I can open in my browser to look at and manage files on my external hard drive. It&rsquo;s very light and easy to use, much simpler than setting up a full file-sharing system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Portainer (Docker Control Panel):</strong> This is a website interface that lets me manage all my Docker containers easily. I can start, stop, update, and check on my programs without typing lots of commands. It makes managing everything much more visual and user-friendly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tailscale (Secure Remote Access):</strong> This program is crucial for connecting to my NAS from anywhere, even when I&rsquo;m not home. Tailscale creates a secure &ldquo;virtual network&rdquo; that connects my devices directly, like a private highway. This means I don&rsquo;t have to deal with complicated router settings (like &ldquo;port forwarding&rdquo;) to get to my files and services securely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As I mentioned, with <em>all</em> these programs usually running, the total RAM used is around <strong>800MB</strong>. Only when Immich&rsquo;s AI starts its heavy work does the RAM temporarily go higher, sometimes up to 3GB. This shows how well these programs and Alpine Linux manage memory.</p>
<h2 id="power-use-saving-money-on-electricity">Power Use: Saving Money on Electricity</h2>
<p>Besides how well it runs, how much electricity a 24/7 server uses is very important, especially where electricity costs a lot (like in many parts of Europe). The Dell J1900 NAS really shines here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When Idle:</strong> It uses only <strong>8 to 12 watts</strong>. This includes the CPU, main board, RAM, and the external hard drive. This is incredibly low for a computer that&rsquo;s always on.</li>
<li><strong>When Working Hard:</strong> Even when Immich is pushing the CPU to 99-100% doing AI tasks, the total electricity use only goes up to <strong>22 to 25 watts</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that even if it runs all day, every day, this NAS costs very little to power. It&rsquo;s a very affordable and environmentally friendly choice compared to bigger, more power-hungry servers or store-bought NAS devices.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-nas-is-not-for-and-why-thats-fine">What This NAS Is NOT For (and Why That&rsquo;s Fine)</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear about what this small computer <em>cannot</em> do:</p>
<ul>
<li>It won&rsquo;t let many people watch 4K movies at the same time.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not for hosting dozens of busy websites or big databases.</li>
<li>It can&rsquo;t run many virtual machines (like a Windows computer running inside your Linux server).</li>
<li>Immich&rsquo;s AI analysis will be slow, taking hours or days for huge photo libraries, but it finishes the job.</li>
</ul>
<p>But for a personal home NAS, backing up photos, sharing files securely, and running essential private services for a small family or one person, it works amazingly well. It shows that you can get great results with less powerful hardware if you choose the right minimalist operating system and efficient containerized applications.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-doing-more-with-less">Conclusion: Doing More With Less</h2>
<p>This little Dell laptop, running Alpine Linux with Docker, is more than just a file server. It proves that you don&rsquo;t need to spend a lot of money or use a lot of electricity to have a strong, private, and capable home server.</p>
<p>It feels great to see all these programs running smoothly, knowing they&rsquo;re using only a small part of the computer&rsquo;s limited power. It&rsquo;s about being efficient, thinking about the environment, and taking control of your own data, even with old hardware. If you have an old, &ldquo;weak&rdquo; computer just sitting there, think about giving it a new purpose as a lean, efficient Alpine NAS. You might be very surprised by what it can do, and your wallet (and maybe even the planet) will thank you.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years, &amp;ldquo;Docker&amp;rdquo; has been synonymous with &amp;ldquo;containers.&amp;rdquo; It revolutionized how we build, ship, and run applications, making complex deployments incredibly simple.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, &ldquo;Docker&rdquo; has been synonymous with &ldquo;containers.&rdquo; It revolutionized how we build, ship, and run applications, making complex deployments incredibly simple. But just like with init systems or file systems, the Linux world thrives on choice and innovation. While Docker remains a dominant force, a powerful challenger has risen from the depths of the Linux ecosystem: <strong>Podman</strong>.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m here to tell you why, for many users (especially those deeply entrenched in the Linux world), Podman isn&rsquo;t just an alternative; it&rsquo;s arguably the <strong>better</strong> container engine.</p>
<h2 id="the-docker-reign-why-it-took-over">The Docker Reign: Why It Took Over</h2>
<p>Docker&rsquo;s meteoric rise was well-deserved. It brought containerization to the masses, simplified complex dependency management, and provided a user-friendly CLI that abstracted away much of the underlying complexity. Its &ldquo;build once, run anywhere&rdquo; promise resonated deeply with developers and operations teams alike. Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS further solidified its position by offering a seamless experience on non-Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>But Docker isn&rsquo;t without its quirks, and as containerization matured, some of its foundational design choices began to show their age, particularly around its daemon-based architecture and evolving licensing terms.</p>
<h2 id="enter-podman-the-daemonless-champion">Enter Podman: The Daemonless Champion</h2>
<p>Podman (short for <strong>Pod Manager</strong>) emerged from Red Hat, designed from the ground up to be a daemonless container engine. It&rsquo;s built to be compatible with Docker&rsquo;s command-line interface, meaning if you know Docker, you already know Podman. But its core differences make it a compelling choice for the modern Linux user.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why Podman is making a strong case for being the superior container engine:</p>
<h3 id="1-no-daemon-no-root-more-security">1. No Daemon, No Root, More Security</h3>
<p>This is Podman&rsquo;s killer feature. Docker relies on a persistent daemon running in the background (the <code>dockerd</code> process), which typically runs as root. This daemon is a single point of failure and a potential security vulnerability. If someone compromises the Docker daemon, they essentially gain root access to your system.</p>
<p>Podman, on the other hand, is <strong>daemonless</strong>. It runs as a normal process, just like any other command-line tool. When you run <code>podman run</code>, it executes, starts your container, and then exits. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Single Point of Failure:</strong> No daemon to crash or be exploited.</li>
<li><strong>Rootless Containers by Default:</strong> You can (and should) run containers as a non-root user. This is a massive security win. If a process inside your container is compromised, it only has the privileges of your user account, not root. This aligns perfectly with the principle of least privilege.</li>
<li><strong>Simpler Architecture:</strong> Less complexity, fewer moving parts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-native-pods-kubernetes-friendly">2. Native Pods: Kubernetes-Friendly</h3>
<p>Podman&rsquo;s name isn&rsquo;t just for show. It natively understands and operates on the concept of <strong>pods</strong>, which are fundamental to Kubernetes. A pod is a group of one or more containers sharing resources like network namespaces and storage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seamless Kubernetes Transition:</strong> Podman makes it incredibly easy to take a <code>pod</code> you&rsquo;ve developed and tested locally and deploy it directly to a Kubernetes cluster. You can use <code>podman generate kube</code> to create Kubernetes YAML from your running pods, streamlining your development-to-production workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Local Multi-Container Management:</strong> Even without Kubernetes, the <code>pod</code> concept allows you to manage related containers as a single unit, which is often how real-world applications are structured.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-systemd-integration-a-linux-native">3. Systemd Integration: A Linux Native</h3>
<p>Because Podman doesn&rsquo;t rely on a daemon, it integrates beautifully with <code>systemd</code>, the default init system for most modern Linux distributions. You can manage your containers directly as <code>systemd</code> services, just like any other application.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robust Service Management:</strong> Leverage <code>systemd</code>&rsquo;s powerful features like dependency management, auto-restarts, resource limits, and logging directly for your containers.</li>
<li><strong>No Daemon Workarounds:</strong> No need for complex <code>systemd</code> unit files to manage a Docker daemon; you&rsquo;re managing the containers themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-open-standards-oci-future-proofing">4. Open Standards (OCI): Future-Proofing</h3>
<p>Podman strictly adheres to Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards for container images and runtimes. This commitment to open standards ensures greater interoperability and avoids vendor lock-in.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OCI Image Specification:</strong> Podman uses OCI images, meaning images built with Docker are compatible with Podman, and vice-versa.</li>
<li><strong>OCI Runtime Specification:</strong> Podman uses OCI-compliant runtimes (like runc, crun), ensuring consistency and security.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-familiarity-the-transition-is-easy">5. Familiarity: The Transition is Easy</h3>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles when switching tools is the learning curve. With Podman, this hurdle is practically non-existent. Most Docker commands work identically with Podman.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>docker run</code> becomes <code>podman run</code></li>
<li><code>docker build</code> becomes <code>podman build</code></li>
<li><code>docker images</code> becomes <code>podman images</code></li>
<li>&hellip;you get the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>This low barrier to entry means you can start experimenting with Podman today without having to relearn your entire container workflow.</p>
<h3 id="6-the-open-source-ethos">6. The Open-Source Ethos</h3>
<p>While Docker has shifted towards a more commercial focus with changes to its Desktop product&rsquo;s licensing, Podman remains fully open-source, maintained by Red Hat and a vibrant community. It&rsquo;s deeply integrated into the Linux ecosystem, making it a natural fit for those who value open standards and community-driven development.</p>
<h2 id="when-docker-still-has-an-edge-the-balance">When Docker Still Has an Edge (The Balance)</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that Docker still holds some advantages, particularly in certain niches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker Desktop:</strong> For Windows and macOS users, Docker Desktop provides an incredibly convenient, integrated experience that bundles a Linux VM, Kubernetes, and a GUI. While Podman offers <code>podman-machine</code> for similar functionality on non-Linux, Docker Desktop is still more mature and polished for these specific OSes.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem Maturity:</strong> Docker&rsquo;s ecosystem is vast, with a massive number of tutorials, third-party integrations, and community solutions built specifically around it. While Podman is catching up rapidly, some niche tools might still assume a Docker environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-make-the-switch-or-try-it">Conclusion: Make the Switch (or Try It!)</h2>
<p>For Linux users, especially those concerned with security, system integration, and open standards, Podman is a highly compelling choice. Its daemonless, rootless architecture is a significant step forward in container security and simplifies system management. Its native support for pods and seamless integration with <code>systemd</code> make it a truly &ldquo;Linux native&rdquo; container engine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still using Docker on Linux, I highly encourage you to give Podman a try. The transition is minimal, the benefits are substantial, and you might just find yourself saying, &ldquo;Yes, Podman is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Take back control, enhance your security, and embrace the future of Linux containerization.</p>

      <title>Self-Hosting: Take Back Your Data (and Your Sanity?)</title>
      <link>https://eeth.pages.dev/blog/self-hosting-take-back-your-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>jayeshjoshi08jj@gmail.com (hkcfs)</author>
      <guid>https://eeth.pages.dev/blog/self-hosting-take-back-your-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in the age of cloud services. Need to store files? Google Drive, Dropbox. Want to watch movies? Netflix, Prime Video. Listen to music? Spotify, Apple Music. It&amp;rsquo;s all there, readily available, just a click away. Convenient? Absolutely. But have you ever stopped to think about where your data actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;? Spoiler alert: it&amp;rsquo;s not really &lt;em&gt;your&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s sitting on someone else&amp;rsquo;s servers, governed by their terms of service, and potentially vulnerable in ways you might not even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in the age of cloud services. Need to store files? Google Drive, Dropbox. Want to watch movies? Netflix, Prime Video. Listen to music? Spotify, Apple Music. It&rsquo;s all there, readily available, just a click away. Convenient? Absolutely. But have you ever stopped to think about where your data actually <em>is</em>? Spoiler alert: it&rsquo;s not really <em>your&rsquo;s</em>. It&rsquo;s sitting on someone else&rsquo;s servers, governed by their terms of service, and potentially vulnerable in ways you might not even imagine.</p>
<p>This is where <strong>self-hosting</strong> comes in. The idea is simple: instead of relying on big tech companies for everything, you host the services you use yourself, on your own hardware, under your own control.</p>
<h2 id="why-bother-self-hosting">Why Bother Self-Hosting?</h2>
<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;Why would I make my life harder? The cloud works perfectly fine!&rdquo; And you&rsquo;re not wrong. Cloud services are slick, user-friendly, and often &ldquo;just work.&rdquo; But there are compelling reasons to consider the self-hosted path:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy and Control:</strong> This is the big one. When you self-host, <em>you</em> control your data. No more worrying about privacy policies changing overnight, algorithms scanning your files, or your data being used to train some AI you never asked for. It&rsquo;s your server, your rules.</li>
<li><strong>Learning and Customization:</strong> Setting up and maintaining your own services is a fantastic learning experience. You&rsquo;ll dive into Linux, networking, security, and a whole bunch of other cool tech stuff. Plus, you get to customize everything exactly how you want it. Tired of the limitations of a cloud service? Self-hosting lets you tweak, modify, and extend to your heart&rsquo;s content.</li>
<li><strong>Potentially Lower Cost (Long Term):</strong> Cloud subscriptions can add up over time. If you&rsquo;re tech-savvy and have some spare hardware lying around (or are willing to invest in a small server), self-hosting can be cheaper in the long run. Think about it: one upfront cost for hardware vs. recurring monthly fees for years.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="its-not-all-sunshine-and-roses-the-challenges">It&rsquo;s Not All Sunshine and Roses (The Challenges)</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be real, self-hosting isn&rsquo;t for everyone. It comes with its own set of challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical Complexity:</strong> Setting up and managing servers requires technical skills. You&rsquo;ll need to be comfortable with the command line, configuration files, and troubleshooting when things go wrong (and they <em>will</em> go wrong, eventually).</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance and Security:</strong> You become your own sysadmin. This means you&rsquo;re responsible for updates, security patches, backups, and ensuring your services are running smoothly. Security is paramount – a misconfigured server can expose your data to the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Setup Time:</strong> Don&rsquo;t expect to have a fully functional self-hosted setup in an afternoon. It takes time, effort, and patience to set everything up correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-can-you-actually-self-host">What Can You Actually Self-Host?</h2>
<p>The possibilities are vast! Here are a few popular examples to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nextcloud:</strong> Your own personal cloud storage and collaboration platform. Think Google Drive/Dropbox, but you control the server. File storage, calendars, contacts, photo galleries, and much more.</li>
<li><strong>Jellyfin:</strong> A free and open-source media server. Stream your movies, TV shows, and music to any device in your home (and even outside). A great alternative to Plex or Emby.</li>
<li><strong>Vaultwarden (Bitwarden-compatible):</strong> A lightweight and open-source password manager. Keep your passwords secure and accessible across all your devices. Why trust your passwords to a third-party when you can host your own?</li>
<li><strong>SearXNG:</strong> A privacy-respecting metasearch engine. Aggregates results from various search engines without tracking you. Take back your search privacy from Google and others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the Trade</h2>
<p>To make self-hosting easier, there are some fantastic tools available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker/Podman:</strong> Containerization is your best friend. These tools allow you to run services in isolated containers, simplifying setup, updates, and management.</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Proxies (Nginx/Caddy):</strong> Essential for routing traffic to different services running on your server and handling SSL/TLS encryption (for secure HTTPS connections).</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic DNS:</strong> If you have a dynamic IP address from your ISP (most home users do), Dynamic DNS services keep your domain name pointed to your current IP address, even when it changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-self-hosting-right-for-you">Is Self-Hosting Right for You?</h2>
<p>Self-hosting isn&rsquo;t a magic bullet. It requires effort and technical know-how. But if you value privacy, control, and learning, it&rsquo;s an incredibly rewarding path to explore. It&rsquo;s about taking back ownership of your digital life, one service at a time.</p>
<p>Maybe you start small, with a password manager or a file storage solution. Or maybe you dive in headfirst and build your own self-hosted empire. The choice is yours. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility&hellip; and maybe a few late nights troubleshooting server issues. But hey, that&rsquo;s part of the fun, right?</p>
