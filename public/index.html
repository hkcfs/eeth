This blog is my little corner of the internet, where I share my adventures in the realms of Linux, Android, and all things technical. From tinkering with hardware to hacking software to make it do the impossible, this space is dedicated to everything I find fascinating about computers and technology.
🛠️ About Me First-time Blogger: This is my first-ever blog, built with Hugo, and I’m learning as I go. So bear with me as I figure things out! Tech Enthusiast: My hobbies include: Running Linux on every possible device 🐧 Pushing hardware to do things it was never meant to do Exploring the wild, untamed world of tech Love AI, almost every part of it This website is not just a blog—it’s an extension of my personality. My goal is to create a space that reflects who I am: curious, experimental, and just a little bit chaotic."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:image" content="https://eeth.pages.dev/images/share.webp"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://eeth.pages.dev/images/share.webp"><meta name=twitter:title content="Home"><meta name=twitter:description content="(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ Welcome to EETH ♥ Hello, world! 🌍
