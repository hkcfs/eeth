<p>Compression algorithms are the silent workhorses that made the internet boom of the 1990s possible. They enabled pirates to download gigabytes of data squeezed into mere megabytes, albeit with a tradeoff: higher electricity bills during decompression or the patience to wait as files unraveled byte by byte.</p>
<p>In modern times, compression is often overlooked. Storage is dirt cheap, and bandwidth feels limitless for most of us. Yet, compression remains invaluable, particularly in data centers and archival zones where storage efficiency takes precedence over speed. It’s no coincidence that popular filesystems like Btrfs, NTFS, and ZFS have built-in compression features. These tools may take a few extra seconds during operation, but they can save organizations thousands of dollars in hard drives or SSDs—a worthy trade-off if you ask me.</p>
<p>But the story today is different. We’ve moved past the era of efficient, practical compression. Now, the pursuit is maximum compression, no matter how long it takes. Shrinking gigabytes of data into a few tens of megabytes is the name of the game. Enter <strong>cmix</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="compression-today-maximum-over-practicality"><strong>Compression Today: Maximum Over Practicality</strong></h2>
<p>Today’s story is different. We’re less interested in efficient, fast compression and more focused on achieving <em>maximum</em> compression ratios. Who cares if it takes seven days to compress a file, as long as we shrink gigabytes of data into a few tens of megabytes? That’s where <strong>cmix</strong> comes in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.byronknoll.com/cmix.html">cmix</a> is a lossless data compression program designed to achieve exceptional compression ratios at the cost of extreme CPU and memory usage. It consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, as seen in benchmarks like the <a href="https://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html">Large Text Compression Benchmark</a> by Matt Mahoney. cmix earned second place, just behind <strong>nncp v3.2</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s the trade-off: cmix is <em>not</em> fast or memory efficient. For instance, in the benchmark:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>nncp v3.2</strong> (1st place) took 241,871 seconds and used 7.6 GB of RAM.</li>
<li><strong>cmix</strong> (2nd place) took 622,949 seconds and consumed 30.95 GB of RAM.</li>
</ul>
<p>While cmix isn’t practical for day-to-day use, it’s an exciting tool for anyone exploring extreme compression.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>Despite its impracticality for everyday use, cmix holds a special place in my heart. It was the first program I compiled while working on my project, <strong>osqr</strong>, and exploring its potential was both fun and enlightening. Compression may feel like a relic of the past, but tools like cmix remind us of the art and science behind squeezing data to its absolute minimum.</p>
<p>If nothing else, cmix is a testament to how far we can push the limits of lossless compression. It may not be practical, but it’s a lot of fun.</p>
