</time>· hkcfs</p><content><p>Recently, I came across <a href=https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient>MTKCLIENT</a>, a fascinating reverse engineering project that aims to hack MediaTek SOCs at a low level. It provides direct access to a device&rsquo;s memory, enabling you to edit partitions, memory, and other critical aspects of the device. The project uses clever exploits within the SOC itself to achieve this.</p><p>MTKCLIENT works perfectly with older MediaTek processors, but when it comes to newer chips (like the 70, 80, and 90 series), it starts to struggle. These newer chips use a completely new protocol called <strong>v6</strong>, which is still less understood and developed compared to the older <strong>v5</strong> protocol.</p><h2 id=why-you-may-ask>Why, you may ask?</h2><p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing: phone manufacturers have decided that letting users install whatever OS they want isn’t <strong>“safe”</strong> anymore. They’ll try to tell you it&rsquo;s for your own protection, especially when it comes to kids or whatever other reasons they come up with to make you believe that restricting your options is the right call.</p><p>It wasn’t that long ago—7 or 8 years, maybe—that you could buy any phone, set it up, and unlock the bootloader in 0 days of the purchasing it, take that you with your 7 days restriction. Fast forward to today, and try doing that with a Samsung. Good luck. Unlocking the bootloader on most modern phones is a pain, and with some brands, it’s just flat-out impossible. This whole situation is what led me to discover MTKClient, which is honestly an awesome tool.</p><p>Until phone makers fix this problem and let users have more control, I’ll stick to devices that make it easy to unlock the bootloader.</p><h2 id=whats-the-deal-with-v6>What&rsquo;s the Deal with V6?</h2><p>The latest MediaTek processors (such as the 70, 80, and 90 series) have introduced the <strong>v6</strong> protocol, which makes things trickier for those trying to modify the system. Unlike older chips, you can’t just flash these devices in the usual way. The <strong>bootrom</strong> (the code that runs during device startup) is <strong>patched</strong>, so you need to use a special <strong>DA (Download Agent)</strong> file and load it via the <code>--loader</code> option. This is essential if you&rsquo;re aiming to modify anything on these newer devices.</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>preloader</strong> (the software responsible for booting the device) might be disabled. However, you can work around this by using the <strong>ADB reboot edl</strong> command, which forces the device into <strong>Emergency Download Mode (EDL)</strong>, allowing you to flash or fix the device.</p><p>Not all devices are created equally. If your device is <strong>UNFUSED</strong>, you&rsquo;re in luck, as there are no hardware security locks in place. However, if your device has extra security features like <strong>DAA</strong> (Device Authentication Algorithm), <strong>SLA</strong> (Secure Loader Authentication), or <strong>Remote-Auth</strong> (Remote Authentication), things get significantly more complicated. These protocols make it much harder to modify the firmware without specialized tools or knowledge.</p><p>Currently, there&rsquo;s no public method to bypass these security measures for devices with DAA, SLA, or Remote-Auth enabled. If you have one of these devices, you&rsquo;re pretty much stuck unless you have access to advanced tools or some obscure communication methods. <a href=https://t.me/>Telegram</a> you might have never heard it, yeah. telegram is the holy grale of all custom rom bootloader unlock adn what not <code>say goodbye</code> to <strong>XDA form</strong> and <code>say Hello</code> to Telegram.</p><p>For the <strong>typical</strong> user, the MTK GUI should suffice, but when dealing with v6, the command-line (CLI) is your only option.</p><h2 id=using-the-mtkclient-v5-devices>Using the MTKCLIENT (v5 devices)</h2><h3 id=requirements>Requirements</h3><ol><li><strong>A MediaTek device with an unlocked bootloader</strong> (or one that supports bootloader unlocking).</li><li><strong>MTKClient tool</strong> installed on your system.</li><li><strong>USB Debugging</strong> enabled on the device.</li><li><strong>OEM Unlocking</strong> enabled in Developer Options.</li></ol><h3 id=step-by-step-guide-to-unlocking-the-bootloader>Step-by-Step Guide to Unlocking the Bootloader</h3><h4 id=1-install-mtkclient>1. <strong>Install MTKClient</strong></h4><ul><li><p>First, clone the MTKClient repository:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=line><span class=ln>1</span><span class=cl>git clone https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient
