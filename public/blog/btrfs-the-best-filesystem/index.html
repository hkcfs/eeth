It cannot even play unmodded Minecraft at 30 FPS or any powerful game. It does not have an HDD because, when I opened it for the very first time (it was my first laptop, and I had never opened a laptop or fixed a computer before), I broke the cable. The HDD was fine, but that garbage cable is so damn weak. I could just blow air on it, and it would break. So, I installed Arch Linux on a 16GB spare USB thumb drive, which—even if it breaks—it does not matter, as it’s a small USB drive:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-text data-lang=text><span class=line><span class=ln>1</span><span class=cl>rw, noatime, compress=zstd:5, nossd, space_cache=v2, autodefrag, commit=120, subvolid=302, subvol=~~somethings~~</span></span></code></pre></div><p>These are my options on the HDD, which I primarily used for data storage. I have been using it for the last two years, and it has served me well since then.</p><p>The thumb drive runs F2FS with compression and some other optimizations, which I took for AI. It runs quite well, and my minimal install of Arch only uses ~4GB compressed with multiple browsers and LabWC—all the comfort I want.</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/linux/>#linux</a>
