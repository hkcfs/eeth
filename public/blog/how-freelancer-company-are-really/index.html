Subject: How Freelancer Company are Really - Sorry if that title is too generic/clickbate</p><p>Hello,</p><p>I have watched many videos of yours old and new & have always loved your work. I&rsquo;m currently still in high school (please redact this), so my English or wording might not be great, and no, I do not want to use ai as it might be taken as spam.</p><p>My father works as a freelancer 10-20 years back it was a great job where people earned handsomely&mldr;.but now it looks like everything is taken granted for&mldr;.<strong>An complete AI model from scratch for $50</strong>, is this some kind of joke and no every freelancing sites are filled with 10,000 people competing for a single project&mldr;and the clients are getting used to this one of my fathers old client came up to develop an AI-tool for Note generation with image generation pdf, doc support and <strong>real time conversation</strong> & a web gui with caching this was 4 months back at the time not a very easy take so my father quotes $300 the client after seeing this asks for to be done in $90&mldr;.how can a person survive in this as no company are hiring and <strong>client think to make facebook it will take you $400 & 3 days</strong> & the best part the client got a the freelancer told him can we work from outside & after aggering he made some kind of a low-AI coded mess when the final payment was done&mldr;the client realised how bad it really was when something stopped working guess what the <strong>freelancer obfuscated the code</strong> the entire project was done for $60, a joke.</p><p>The freelancing sites themselves, once you make this mistake there is nothing to do my father does very niche work so not a lot of projects but the worst part is that, <strong>ALL FREELANCING SITE TAKE A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION OF $10-$40/month and even after that 10% or $5 from every transaction</strong> so a $6000 project the is actually $5400 and worst part of them all the clients has to pay $6606 so it is more like 20% and for that what yo get nothing&mldr;.My father did a project $90 to setup nextcloud, with custom theming, an email server and make the server secure yes all that for $90 & at the very end when the job was completed the client told there was a mistake and told that we missed the deadline it was 2 AM my father told him that can we work tomorrow as it was very late for him&mldr;the client furious put a tantrum and then decided to ask for freelancer support and guess want we had to refund everything for free and gets to keep our work & if that was not enough a <strong>2 week ban</strong>, guess what the client did not get any ban or suc in fact they made a new post to fix the issues in the current project for $2 when we told freelancer.com they just gave us a generic responce to stay out of trouble&mldr;this is how we used to make ends meal, after after this one inciden we have constant have been penalized for this now we fell like it is a daily routeen every 3 week -$150 and a ban for 5 days for some new garbage they made up.</p><p>It is now, i am writing you as we are not big in the tech world and you do have an audience, <strong>recently my account was suspended</strong> for no reason when asking freelancer they mailed use that you have violated the policy to many time, they deducted our months income completely for have outside transactions they didn&rsquo;t even bother to show use any evidence I am not sure in <strong>which country hiding evidence is allowed when you are making an accusation</strong>, and even had the <strong>audacity to charge our credit card now that is too much</strong>. I am very frustrated that how freelancer like my father have to struggle, hope you can shed some light to this also this is all on x.com/twitter on the profile BharatBjoshi <a href=https://x.com/BharatBjoshi>x.com/BharatBjoshi</a> please check</p><p>Sorry, if this looks like a rant but I am very furious at how these websites treated my father, if you want I will try to collect evidence to share it with you.</p><p>Thanks & Regards,
Jayesh Joshi.</p><p>Nothing more to add this sums up everything.</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/freelancing/>#freelancing</a>
