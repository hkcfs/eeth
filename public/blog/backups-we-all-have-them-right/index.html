&ldquo;A backup isn’t just about saving data; it’s about saving yourself from the regret of losing what matters most.&rdquo;

Well, backups are the bane of my existence. No, really. I have multiple backups of all my data. I try to follow the 3-2-1 backup plan, which means:

3 Copies of Data
2 Different Media
1 Copy Offsite

This is what I generally like to do, but most of my data pre-COVID was scattered across multiple HDDs with no plan for where the data was stored and no automation."><meta name=author content="hkcfs"><meta name=keywords content="backup,"><meta property="og:title" content="Backups - we all have them right ?"><meta property="og:description" content="Backups - we all have them, right?

Many might not like Mega Cloud because of its controversial history, especially involving its creator, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Dotcom>Kim Dotcom</a>. However, I feel it’s a good platform with security in mind. That said, it doesn’t have a great history, so I still encrypt everything locally on a Linux box before sending the data to any cloud, as <strong>the cloud is just someone else’s computer</strong>. Always believe that anyone can view or modify that data. If you’re on a free plan like me, keep redundancy in mind. Losing a &ldquo;free&rdquo; account with all your data is not something any cloud service provider will care about. So, go for the cheapest plan if you want to.</p><p>If you want to go free, do so with caution, and always keep in mind that data can be lost at any time. Always keep a local backup or something that might help you when disaster strikes.</p><p>Backups are a very personal thing. Many of us have very different requirements, and there is no one great tool or solution for all. Experimentation is very much encouraged. But just have a backup—it’s much better than being among the 50% of people who have no backup.</p><p>For example, YouTubers might have a lot of videos and images, so they might need multiple TBs of storage. But someone like me, who has some images, videos, a simple blog, and configuration files, might only need around 50GB. My current backup is ~67GB, including images, videos, configuration files, and important documents. I use Mega and have been for a long time. Mega only gives you 20GB free now, but when I created my account, it gave me 50GB, which is now very much filled with less than 2GB free.</p><p>I suggest that anyone about to back up seriously should first check their needs. Can it just be handled with a free account, or do you need more, like a subscription? I would say if you have less than 150GB, then the free tier would be enough, though above 100GB, it would be a stretch. But if you have more than that, then a paid solution would suit you well. No matter what, if you do not have a backup, then do it now. Even just having a copy on an external drive is better than no backup. Take action now—your future self will thank you.</p></content><p><a class=blog-tags href=/tags/backup/>#backup</a></p><p><a href='mailto:jayeshjoshi08jj@gmail.com?subject=Reply%20to%20"Backups%20-%20we%20all%20have%20them%20right%20%3f"'>Reply to this post by email ↪</a></p></main><footer><small>hkcfs | Made with <a href=https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub>Bear Cub</a> & <a href=https://freedns.afraid.org>freedns</a></small></footer></body></html>
